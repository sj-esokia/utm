 * configuration synchronization, and dependent configuration will remain
 * intact. This affects only configuration synchronization; single import and
 * export of configuration are not affected.
 *
 * Drupal does not validate or sanity check the list of excluded modules. For
 * instance, it is your own responsibility to never exclude required modules,
 * because it would mean that the exported configuration can not be imported
 * anymore.
